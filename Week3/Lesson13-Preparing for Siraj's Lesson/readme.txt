Recurrent Neural Network(RNNs)--循环神经网络
Long-Short Term Memory(LSTMs)


Resources
Christopher Olah's blog post on RNNs and LSTMs.
This is the shortest and most accessible read.
Deep Learning Book chapter on RNNs.
This will be a very technical read and is recommended for students very comfortable with advanced mathematical notation and scientific papers.
Andrej Karpathy's lecture on Recurrent Neural Networks.
This is a fairly long lecture (around an hour) but covers the content quite well as always with Karpathy.
